	<h1>What is?</h1>

	<p>
		This app lets you get a list of channels you follow that are live, filtered by a set of parameters.
	</p>

	<p>
		I made it because I moderate a channel and wanted a tool to find potential raid targets for the streamer. I follow a <em>lot</em> of channels and needed a more condensed and structured overview. I also want to avoid raiding into streams as they end.
